We intuitively know that a plane is \"bigger\" than a line, and 3D space is \"bigger\" than a plane. But in the abstract world of vector spaces, we need a rigorous way to measure this.\n\nThe answer lies in the number of vectors in a basis. But there's a potential problem: what if one person finds a basis with 3 vectors, and another person finds a basis for the same space with 4 vectors? If that were possible, our entire concept of \"size\" would collapse.\n\nIn this section, we prove the most important technical result of the chapter: the **Steinitz Replacement Theorem**. This theorem is the \"engine\" that guarantees every basis of a space has the exact same number of vectors. Once we have this, we can finally define the **Dimension** of a space—a single number that captures its fundamental complexity.\n\n::: {#thm-sift}\n## Sifting Method\n\nLet \\( S = \\{ \\vv_1, \\vv_2, \\dots, \\vv_m \\} \\) be a subset of \\( V \\).

Remove \\( \\vv_r \\) from \\( S' \\) if \\( \\vv_r \\) is a linear combination of \\( \\vv_1, \\vv_2, \\dots, \\vv_{r-1} \\) (redundant).\n\nAfter this process, we obtain a subset \\( S' \\) in which no element is a linear combination of the preceding members anymore. Therefore, by @thm-linear-dependence-lemma, \\( S' \\) is linearly independent. Moreover, according to @thm-span-preservation, removing \"redundant members\" from \\( S \\) does not change its linear span. Therefore, we have \\( \\Span(S') = \\Span(S) \\).\n:::\n\n::: {.remark}\nThe sifting method is a powerful algorithmic tool that allows us to \"clean up\" any set of vectors. Given any collection of vectors, we can systematically remove the redundant ones while preserving the span. This gives us a \"cleaned\" version that is linearly independent and spans the same space.\n\nThis method becomes our \"new weapon\" in linear algebra proofs. Whenever we encounter a set that might have redundant vectors, we can apply the sifting method to obtain a linearly independent subset with the same span. This technique will be particularly useful in proving results about dimension and in constructing bases from spanning sets.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-sifting}\n## Sifting Example\n\nConsider \\( S = \\{ \\vv_1, \\vv_2, \\vv_3, \\vv_4, \\vv_5, \\vv_6 \\} \\) in \\( \\nR^3 \\) where:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vv_1 &= (1, 1, 1), & \\vv_2 &= (2, 2, 2), & \\vv_3 &= (1, 0, 0), \\\\\n\\vv_4 &= (3, 2, 2), & \\vv_5 &= (1, 1, 0), & \\vv_6 &= (0, 0, 1).\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe apply the sifting method:\n\n- \\( \\vv_1 \\neq \\vzero \\), so \\( \\vv_1 \\) is kept.\n- \\( \\vv_2 = 2\\vv_1 \\), so \\( \\vv_2 \\) is removed.\n- \\( \\vv_3 \\) is not a linear combination of \\( \\vv_1 \\), so \\( \\vv_3 \\) is kept.\n- \\( \\vv_4 = 2\\vv_1 + 1\\vv_3 \\), so \\( \\vv_4 \\) is removed.\n- Suppose \\( \\vv_5 = a\\vv_1 + b\\vv_3 \\). Then \\( (1, 1, 0) = (a + b, a, a) \\), which gives \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( a + b = 1 \\), so \\( b = 1 \\). But then the second coordinate gives \\( 1 = a = 0 \\), which is a contradiction. So \\( \\vv_5 \\) is not a linear combination of \\( \\vv_1, \\vv_3 \\). Hence, \\( \\vv_5 \\) is kept.\n- Since \\( \\dim(\\nR^3) = 3 \\), any four vectors cannot be linearly independent. Therefore, \\( \\vv_6 \\) must be a linear combination of \\( \\vv_1, \\vv_3, \\vv_5 \\). So \\( \\vv_6 \\) is removed.\n\nThe sifted set is \\( S' = \\{ \\vv_1, \\vv_3, \\vv_5 \\} = \\{ (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0) \\} \\), which is linearly independent and spans the same space as \\( S \\).\n:::\n\n::: {#thm-steinitz}\n## Steinitz Exchange/Replacement Theorem\n\nLet \\( V \\) be a vector space over \\( F \\).

We rely on the fact that if we add a vector \\( \\vw \\) to a spanning set \\( S \\), the set \\( \\{ \\vw \\} \\cup S \\) becomes linearly dependent, allowing us to remove a redundant vector (by @thm-span-preservation).\n\nConsider the first step. We form the set \\( B_1 \\) by inserting \\( \\vu_1 \\) into \\( G \\):\n\\[\n\tB_1 = \\{ \\vu_1, \\vv_1, \\dots, \\vv_n \\}.\n\\]\nSince \\( G \\) spans \\( V \\), \\( B_1 \\) is linearly dependent. By applying the sifting process (@thm-sift), we can remove a vector to obtain a new spanning set \\( G_1 \\). Since \\( L \\) is linearly independent, \\( \\vu_1 \\neq \\vzero \\), so the removed vector must be some \\( \\vv_i \\). Thus:\n\\[\n\tG_1 = \\{ \\vu_1 \\} \\cup S_1,\n\\]\nwhere \\( S_1 \\) is a subset of \\( G \\) with size \\( n-1 \\).\n\nNow, consider the general step. Suppose we have successfully exchanged \\( k \\) vectors such that the set\n\\[\n\tG_k = \\{ \\vu_1, \\dots, \\vu_k \\} \\cup S_k\n\\]\nspans \\( V \\), where \\( S_k \\subset G \\) contains \\( n-k \\) vectors. We insert the next vector \\( \\vu_{k+1} \\) to form:\n\\[\n\tB_{k+1} = \\{ \\vu_{k+1} \\} \\cup G_k.\n\\]\nSince \\( G_k \\) is a spanning set, \\( \\vu_{k+1} \\) depends on the vectors in \\( G_k \\), making \\( B_{k+1} \\) dependent. We must remove a vector to restore the spanning property. We cannot remove any of the \\( \\vu_i \\)'s, as this would imply a linear dependence relation exclusively among elements of \\( L \\), contradicting the hypothesis that \\( L \\) is linearly independent. Therefore, we must remove some \\( \\vv_j \\) from \\( S_k \\).\n\nThis process generates a sequence of subsets of remaining \\( \\vv \\)'s:\n\\[\n\tn = |G| > |S_1| > |S_2| > \\dots > |S_m| \\geq 0.\n\\]\nSince we are able to perform this exchange \\( m \\) times (once for each \\( \\vu \\in L \\)), we must have started with enough \\( \\vv \\)'s to accommodate every removal.

Thus, \\( S' \\) is a basis for \\( V \\) that contains \\( S \\).\n:::\n\n::: {#cor-basis-existence}\n## Existence of Basis\n\nEvery finite spanning set of a vector space \\( V \\) contains a basis.\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\nApply the Sifting Method to the spanning set. The resulting subset \\( S' \\) is linearly independent by construction and still spans \\( V \\). Therefore, \\( S' \\) is a basis for \\( V \\).\n:::\n\n::: {#thm-dim-impl-eq}\n## Dimension Implies Equality\n\nLet \\( V \\) and \\( W \\) be finite-dimensional vector spaces over \\( F \\). If\n\n1. \\( W \\subseteq V \\);\n2. \\( \\dim_F (W) = \\dim_F (V) \\),\n\nthen \\( W = V \\).\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\nIf we show \\( V \\subseteq W \\) then we are done. Suppose for contradiction that \\( V \\nsubseteq W \\). That means there exists some \\( \\vv \\in V \\) that \\( \\vv \\notin W \\).\n\nLet \\( S = \\{ \\vw_1, \\dots, \\vw_n \\} \\) be a basis of \\( W \\), (consequently, \\( \\dim_F (W) = n \\)). Since \\( \\vv \\notin W \\), we have \\( \\vv \\notin \\Span(S) \\).\n\nThat would mean that \\( S' = \\{ \\vw_1, \\dots, \\vw_n, \\vv \\} \\) is linearly independent in \\( V \\). By Replacement Theorem, we have\n\\[\n\t\\underbrace{|S'|}_{\\text{size of lin. indep. set}} \\leq \\dim_F (V),\n\\]\nwhich implies \\( n + 1 \\leq n \\), which is a contradiction, therefore \\( V \\subseteq W \\).\n:::\n\n::: {.remark}\nThis theorem makes proving \\( W = V \\) somewhat easier. As if we wanted to prove equivalence before, we can only do it by proving \\( W \\subseteq V \\) and \\( V \\subseteq W \\). Now we can just prove one side and then state that their dimension is the same.\n:::\n\nAn immediate consequence of the above theorem is the following:\n\n::: {#thm-maximal-indep}\n## Maximal Independent Subset is a Basis\n\nLet \\( V \\) be a vector space of dimension \\( n \\) over \\( F \\). Then any \\( n \\) independent vectors form a basis of \\( V \\).\n(We say that \"any maximal linearly independent subset forms a basis\").\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\nLet \\( S \\) be a linearly independent set of size \\( n \\). We want to show that \\( \\Span(S) = V \\).\n\nLet \\( W = \\Span(S) \\), this implies that \\( W \\) is a subspace of \\( V \\), which implies \\( W \\subseteq V \\).\n\nNotice that \\( S \\) spans \\( W \\) and \\( S \\) is linearly independent, therefore \\( S \\) is a basis of \\( W \\). So \\( \\dim_F (W) = |S| = n = \\dim_F (V) \\). By @thm-dim-impl-eq, we have \\( W = V \\), then \\( \\Span(S) = V \\).\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+tex_math_single_backslash","filters":["mermaid-static","theorem-numbering","latex-environment","chapter-number"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"html-math-method":"mathjax","css":["../../config/html-styles.css"],"include-after-body":{"text":"<script>\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  // ==========================================\n  // 0.
