# Functions

::: {#def-function}
## Function

A **function** \( f \) from a set \( A \) to a set \( B \), denoted \( f: A \to B \), is a rule that assigns to each element \( a \in A \) exactly one element \( f(a) \in B \). The set \( A \) is called the **domain** and \( B \) is called the **codomain**.
:::

::: {#def-injective-surjective-bijective}
## Injective, Surjective, Bijective

Let \( f: A \to B \) be a function.

- \( f \) is **injective** (one-to-one) if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \) implies \( a_1 = a_2 \).
- \( f \) is **surjective** (onto) if for every \( b \in B \), there exists \( a \in A \) such that \( f(a) = b \).
- \( f \) is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective

::: {#exm-injective-surjective-bijective}
## Injective, Surjective, and Bijective Functions

Consider the following functions:

1. \( f: \nR \to \nR \), \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \) is **bijective**.

    - Injective: If \( 2x_1 + 1 = 2x_2 + 1 \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \).
    - Surjective: For any \( y \in \nR \), we have \( f\left(\frac{y-1}{2}\right) = y \).

2. \( g: \nR \to \nR \), \( g(x) = x^2 \) is **neither injective nor surjective**.

    - Not injective: \( g(1) = g(-1) = 1 \), but \( 1 \neq -1 \).
    - Not surjective: There is no \( x \in \nR \) such that \( g(x) = -1 \).

3. \( h: \nR \to [0, \infty) \), \( h(x) = x^2 \) is **surjective but not injective**.

    - Not injective: \( h(1) = h(-1) = 1 \).
    - Surjective: For any \( y \geq 0 \), we have \( h(\sqrt{y}) = y \).

4. \( k: [0, \infty) \to \nR \), \( k(x) = x^2 \) is **injective but not surjective**.

    - Injective: If \( x_1^2 = x_2^2 \) with \( x_1, x_2 \geq 0 \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \).
    - Not surjective: There is no \( x \geq 0 \) such that \( k(x) = -1 \).
