# Equivalence Relations

In mathematics, we often want to say that two objects are "the same" in some sense, even if they are not identical. For instance:

- Two fractions \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{2}{4} \) represent the same rational number.
- Two matrices \( \A \) and \( \B \) are **similar** if \( \B = \P^{-1}\A\P \) for some invertible \( \P \)—they represent the same linear transformation in different bases.
- Two vector spaces are **isomorphic** if there exists a bijective linear map between them—they have the same "structure."

Each of these notions of "sameness" is captured by an **equivalence relation**. Understanding equivalence relations helps us recognize when different-looking objects are fundamentally alike.

## Relations

::: {#def-relation}
## Relation

A **(binary) relation** on a set \( A \) is a subset \( R \subseteq A \times A \). If \( (a, b) \in R \), we write \( a \sim b \) (or \( a \mathrel{R} b \)) and say "\( a \) is related to \( b \)."
:::

::: {#exm-relations}
## Examples of Relations

Here are some common examples of relations:

1. On \( \nZ \), define \( a \sim b \) if \( a \leq b \). This is the "less than or equal to" relation.

2. On \( \nR \), define \( a \sim b \) if \( |a - b| < 1 \). This says \( a \) and \( b \) are "close."

3. On the set of all people, define \( a \sim b \) if \( a \) and \( b \) have the same birthday.
:::

## Equivalence Relations

Not all relations behave like "sameness." An **equivalence relation** is one that satisfies three natural properties that any notion of sameness should have.

::: {#def-equivalence-relation}
## Equivalence Relation

A relation \( \sim \) on a set \( A \) is an **equivalence relation** if it satisfies:

1. **Reflexivity:** \( \forall a \in A : a \sim a \).

   (Every element is related to itself.)

2. **Symmetry:** \( \forall a, b \in A : a \sim b \Rightarrow b \sim a \).

   (If \( a \) is related to \( b \), then \( b \) is related to \( a \).)

3. **Transitivity:** \( \forall a, b, c \in A : (a \sim b \land b \sim c) \Rightarrow a \sim c \).

   (If \( a \) is related to \( b \) and \( b \) is related to \( c \), then \( a \) is related to \( c \).)
:::

::: {#exm-equivalence-relations}
## Examples of Equivalence Relations

The following are all equivalence relations:

1. **Equality:** On any set \( A \), the relation \( a \sim b \iff a = b \) is an equivalence relation (the finest one possible).

2. **Congruence modulo \( n \):** On \( \nZ \), define \( a \equiv b \pmod{n} \) if \( n \mid (a - b) \).

   - Reflexive: \( n \mid 0 \), so \( a \equiv a \).
   - Symmetric: If \( n \mid (a - b) \), then \( n \mid (b - a) \).
   - Transitive: If \( n \mid (a - b) \) and \( n \mid (b - c) \), then \( n \mid ((a - b) + (b - c)) = (a - c) \).

3. **Same birthday:** On the set of people, "\( a \) has the same birthday as \( b \)" is an equivalence relation.

4. **Same absolute value:** On \( \nR \), define \( a \sim b \iff |a| = |b| \). This is an equivalence relation.
:::

::: {#exm-non-equivalence}
## Non-Examples

The following relations fail to be equivalence relations:

1. On \( \nZ \), the relation \( a \leq b \) is **not** an equivalence relation:

   - Reflexive: Yes, \( a \leq a \).
   - Symmetric: **No.** \( 1 \leq 2 \) but \( 2 \not\leq 1 \).

2. On \( \nR \), the relation \( |a - b| < 1 \) is **not** an equivalence relation:

   - Reflexive: Yes, \( |a - a| = 0 < 1 \).
   - Symmetric: Yes.
   - Transitive: **No.** We have \( |0 - 0.6| < 1 \) and \( |0.6 - 1.2| < 1 \), but \( |0 - 1.2| = 1.2 \not< 1 \).
:::

## Equivalence Classes

An equivalence relation partitions a set into disjoint groups of "equivalent" elements. Each such group is called an **equivalence class**.

::: {#def-equivalence-class}
## Equivalence Class

Let \( \sim \) be an equivalence relation on \( A \). The **equivalence class** of an element \( a \in A \) is the set of all elements equivalent to \( a \):
\[
    [a] = \{ b \in A : b \sim a \}
\]
The element \( a \) is called a **representative** of the class \( [a] \).
:::

::: {#exm-equivalence-classes}
## Examples of Equivalence Classes

We illustrate equivalence classes with two examples:

1. **Congruence modulo 3:** The equivalence classes of \( \nZ \) under \( \equiv \pmod{3} \) are:
   \begin{align*}
       [0] &= \{ \ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, \ldots \} \\
       [1] &= \{ \ldots, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10, \ldots \} \\
       [2] &= \{ \ldots, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, 11, \ldots \}
   \end{align*}
   Note that \( [0] = [3] = [6] = \cdots \) and \( [1] = [4] = [7] = \cdots \). Different representatives can name the same class.

2. **Same absolute value on \( \nR \):** The equivalence class of \( 2 \) is \( [2] = \{ -2, 2 \} \). The equivalence class of \( 0 \) is \( [0] = \{ 0 \} \).
:::

::: {#thm-partition}
## Equivalence Classes Partition the Set

Let \( \sim \) be an equivalence relation on \( A \). Then:

1. Every element belongs to some equivalence class: \( a \in [a] \).
2. Two equivalence classes are either equal or disjoint: \( [a] = [b] \) or \( [a] \cap [b] = \varnothing \).
3. The union of all equivalence classes is \( A \).

In other words, the equivalence classes form a **partition** of \( A \).
:::

::: {.proof}
(1) By reflexivity, \( a \sim a \), so \( a \in [a] \).

(2) Suppose \( [a] \cap [b] \neq \varnothing \), and let \( c \in [a] \cap [b] \). Then \( c \sim a \) and \( c \sim b \). By symmetry, \( a \sim c \). By transitivity, \( a \sim b \).

Now we show \( [a] = [b] \). Let \( x \in [a] \), so \( x \sim a \). Since \( a \sim b \), by transitivity \( x \sim b \), so \( x \in [b] \). Thus \( [a] \subseteq [b] \). By symmetry, \( [b] \subseteq [a] \), so \( [a] = [b] \).

(3) Follows from (1): every element \( a \) is in \( [a] \).
:::

::: {#def-quotient-set}
## Quotient Set

Let \( \sim \) be an equivalence relation on \( A \). The **quotient set** (or **quotient of \( A \) by \( \sim \)**) is the set of all equivalence classes:
\[
    A / {\sim} = \{ [a] : a \in A \}
\]
:::

::: {#exm-quotient-set}
## Quotient Sets

The following are examples of quotient sets:

1. \( \nZ / {\equiv_3} = \{ [0], [1], [2] \} \) has three elements. This is often written \( \nZ / 3\nZ \) or \( \nZ_3 \).

2. The quotient of \( \nR \) by "same absolute value" is in bijection with \( [0, \infty) \)—each equivalence class is determined by its absolute value.
:::

## Equivalence Relations in Linear Algebra

The following equivalence relations will appear throughout your study of linear algebra:

::: {#exm-similarity}
## Matrix Similarity

On \( M_n(F) \), define \( \A \sim \B \) if there exists an invertible matrix \( \P \in M_n(F) \) such that \( \B = \P^{-1}\A\P \). This is called **similarity**.

- Reflexive: \( \A = \I^{-1}\A\I \), so \( \A \sim \A \).
- Symmetric: If \( \B = \P^{-1}\A\P \), then \( \A = \P\B\P^{-1} = (\P^{-1})^{-1}\B(\P^{-1}) \), so \( \B \sim \A \).
- Transitive: If \( \B = \P^{-1}\A\P \) and \( \C = \Q^{-1}\B\Q \), then \( \C = \Q^{-1}\P^{-1}\A\P\Q = (\P\Q)^{-1}\A(\P\Q) \).

Similar matrices represent the same linear transformation in different bases. They share many properties: determinant, trace, eigenvalues, and characteristic polynomial.
:::

::: {#exm-row-equivalence}
## Row Equivalence

Two matrices are **row equivalent** if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of elementary row operations. This is an equivalence relation on \( M_{m \times n}(F) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
When you encounter a new equivalence relation, ask: "What properties do equivalent objects share?" For similarity, the answer includes eigenvalues and determinant. These shared properties are called **invariants** of the equivalence relation.
