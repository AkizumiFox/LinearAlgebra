# Polynomials

::: {#def-polynomial}
## Polynomial

A **polynomial** over a field \( F \) in the indeterminate \( x \) is an expression of the form:
\[
	p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^k
\]
where \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n \in F \) are called the **coefficients** of \( p(x) \).
:::

::: {#def-degree}
## Degree

Let \( p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) be a nonzero polynomial with \( a_n \neq 0 \). The **degree** of \( p(x) \), denoted \( \deg p(x) \), is \( n \). The coefficient \( a_n \) is called the **leading coefficient**.

By convention, the zero polynomial \( p(x) = 0 \) has degree \( -\infty \).
:::

::: {#def-polynomial-ring}
## Polynomial Ring

The set of all polynomials over a field \( F \) is denoted \( F[x] \):
\[
	F[x] = \left\{ \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^k : n \in \nN, \, a_k \in F \right\}
\]
This set forms a **ring** under polynomial addition and multiplication. (You can omit what ring means here.)
:::

::: {#exm-elements-of-rx}
## Elements of the Polynomial Ring

The following are elements of \( \nR[x] \):
\[
	3x^2 - 2x + 1, \quad x^5 + \pi x^3 - \sqrt{2}, \quad 7, \quad 0
\]
Note that constant polynomials (including \( 0 \)) are also polynomials.
:::

In linear algebra, we often work with polynomials of bounded degree.

::: {#def-polynomials-bounded-degree}
## Polynomials of Degree at Most \( n \)

Let \( F \) be a field and \( n \in \nN \). The set of all polynomials over \( F \) of degree at most \( n \) is denoted:
\[
	F[x]_{\leq n} = \left\{ p(x) \in F[x] : \deg p(x) \leq n \right\}
\]
Equivalently:
\[
	F[x]_{\leq n} = \left\{ a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 : a_k \in F \right\}
\]
:::

::: {#exm-elements-of-rx-leq-2}
## Polynomials of Degree at Most 2

The set \( \nR[x]_{\leq 2} \) consists of all polynomials of degree at most \( 2 \):
\[
	\nR[x]_{\leq 2} = \{ ax^2 + bx + c : a, b, c \in \nR \}
\]
Examples include \( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \), \( 5x + 7 \), and \( -4 \).
:::

::: {#def-polynomials-exact-degree}
## Polynomials of Degree Exactly \( n \)

We use \( F[x]_{=n} \) to denote polynomials of degree **exactly** \( n \):
\[
	F[x]_{=n} = \left\{ p(x) \in F[x] : \deg p(x) = n \right\}
\]
Equivalently:
\[
	F[x]_{=n} = \left\{ a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 : a_n \neq 0, \, a_k \in F \right\}
\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Note the distinction:

- \( F[x]_{\leq n} \) contains polynomials of degree \( \leq n \) (including the zero polynomial)
- \( F[x]_{=n} \) contains polynomials of degree **exactly** \( n \) (so \( a_n \neq 0 \))

Thus \( F[x]_{\leq n} \supsetneq F[x]_{=n} \), and in fact \( F[x]_{\leq n} = F[x]_{=n} \cup F[x]_{\leq n-1} \).
:::

::: {#exm-comparing-notations}
## Comparing Notations

The following examples highlight the difference between the notations introduced above:

- \( \nR[x]_{\leq 2} = \{ ax^2 + bx + c : a, b, c \in \nR \} \) includes \( x^2 + 1 \), \( 3x - 2 \), and \( 5 \)
- \( \nR[x]_{=2} = \{ ax^2 + bx + c : a \neq 0, \, a, b, c \in \nR \} \) includes \( x^2 + 1 \) but **not** \( 3x - 2 \) or \( 5 \)
