# Sets and Notation

Sets are the foundation of modern mathematics. In linear algebra, we study *vector spaces*, which are sets equipped with operations; *subspaces*, which are subsets with special properties; and *linear maps*, which are functions between sets. This section establishes the notation and operations we will use throughout.

## Number Sets

We begin by defining the standard sets of numbers used throughout this book.

::: {#def-common-number-sets}
## Common Number Sets

We use the following notation for common sets of numbers:

- \( \nN \): The set of natural numbers \( \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\} \).
- \( \nZ \): The set of integers \( \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \).
- \( \nQ \): The set of rational numbers.
- \( \nR \): The set of real numbers.
- \( \nC \): The set of complex numbers.

::: {#def-cartesian-product}
## Cartesian Product

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets. The **Cartesian product** of \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \times B \), is the set of all ordered pairs:
\[
	A \times B = \{(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\}
\]
More generally, for sets \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \), the Cartesian product is:
\[
	A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n = \{(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) : a_i \in A_i \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n\}
\]
:::

::: {#def-n-tuple}
## \( n \)-Tuple

An **\( n \)-tuple** is an ordered list of \( n \) elements. For a set \( A \), the set of all \( n \)-tuples with entries from \( A \) is denoted:
\[
	A^n = \underbrace{A \times A \times \cdots \times A}_{n \text{ times}} = \{(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) : a_i \in A \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n\}
\]
:::

::: {#exm-n-tuples}
## \( n \)-Tuples

Here are examples of \( n \)-tuples from various sets:

1. \( \nR^2 \): The Cartesian plane. Elements include \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 2) \), \( (-3, \pi) \), \( (\sqrt{2}, -5.7) \).

2. \( \nR^3 \): 3-dimensional space. Elements include \( (1, 0, 0) \), \( (1, 2, 3) \), \( (-1, \pi, e) \).

3. \( \nZ^2 \): Pairs of integers. Elements include \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, -2) \), \( (5, 7) \). Note that \( (\frac{1}{2}, 3) \notin \nZ^2 \).

4. \( \nC^2 \): Pairs of complex numbers. Elements include \( (1+i, 2-3i) \), \( (i, 0) \), \( (3, 4) \).

5. \( \{0, 1\}^3 \): Binary 3-tuples. This set has exactly 8 elements:
     \[
	\{0,1\}^3 = \{(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)\}
\]

In general, if \( A \) is a finite set with \( |A| = k \) elements, then \( A^n \) has \( k^n \) elements.
:::

## Set-Builder Notation and the Empty Set

When defining sets, we often describe them by specifying a property that their elements must satisfy.

::: {#def-set-builder}
## Set-Builder Notation

Let \( S \) be a set and \( P(x) \) a predicate. The **set-builder notation**
\[
        \{ x \in S : P(x) \}
\]
denotes the set of all elements \( x \) in \( S \) for which \( P(x) \) is true. Variants include \( \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} \) and \( \{ x \in S \,;\, P(x) \} \).
:::

::: {#exm-set-builder}
## Set-Builder Examples

The following sets are defined using set-builder notation:

1. \( \{ x \in \nR : x^2 < 4 \} = (-2, 2) \), the open interval from \( -2 \) to \( 2 \).

2. \( \{ n \in \nZ : n \text{ is even} \} = \{ \ldots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \} \).

3. \( \{ (x, y) \in \nR^2 : x + y = 1 \} \) is the line through \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \).
:::

::: {#def-empty-set}
## Empty Set

The **empty set**, denoted \( \varnothing \) or \( \{\} \), is the set containing no elements:
\[
        \varnothing = \{ x : x \neq x \}
\]
For any element \( a \), we have \( a \notin \varnothing \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Statements of the form "\( \forall x \in \varnothing : P(x) \)" are **vacuously true**—there are no elements to check. This technicality appears when discussing trivial subspaces or the span of an empty collection.
:::

## Subsets

The concept of a *subset* is central to linear algebra. When we define a subspace, we first verify it is a subset of the ambient space.

::: {#def-subset}
## Subset

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets. We say \( A \) is a **subset** of \( B \), written \( A \subseteq B \), if every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \):
\[
        A \subseteq B \iff \forall x : (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B)
\]

If \( A \subseteq B \) and \( A \neq B \), we say \( A \) is a **proper subset** of \( B \), written \( A \subsetneq B \) or \( A \subset B \).
:::

::: {#exm-subsets}
## Subset Examples

The following illustrate subset relationships:

1. \( \nN \subsetneq \nZ \subsetneq \nQ \subsetneq \nR \subsetneq \nC \).

2. \( \{ 1, 2 \} \subseteq \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \), and \( \{ 1, 2 \} \subsetneq \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \).

3. For any set \( A \): \( \varnothing \subseteq A \) and \( A \subseteq A \).

4. \( \{ x \in \nR : x^2 = 1 \} = \{ -1, 1 \} \subseteq \nZ \).
:::

::: {#def-set-equality}
## Set Equality

Two sets \( A \) and \( B \) are **equal**, written \( A = B \), if they contain exactly the same elements:
\[
        A = B \iff (A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A)
\]
:::

::: {.remark}
To prove two sets are equal, we typically prove **two subset inclusions**: first show \( A \subseteq B \), then show \( B \subseteq A \). This technique appears constantly when proving that two subspaces or spans are equal.
:::

## Set Operations

Sets can be combined using union, intersection, and difference. These operations appear when discussing sums of subspaces and their intersections.

::: {#def-union}
## Union

The **union** of sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of elements in \( A \) or \( B \) (or both):
\[
        A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}
\]
:::

::: {#def-intersection}
## Intersection

The **intersection** of sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of elements in both \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
        A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}
\]

Two sets are **disjoint** if \( A \cap B = \varnothing \).
:::

::: {#def-set-difference}
## Set Difference

The **set difference** (or **relative complement**) of \( B \) in \( A \) is:
\[
        A \setminus B = \{ x \in A : x \notin B \}
\]

When \( B \subseteq U \) for some universal set \( U \), the **complement** of \( B \) in \( U \) is \( B^c = U \setminus B \).
:::

::: {#exm-set-operations}
## Set Operations

Let \( A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \} \) and \( B = \{ 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \). Then:

- \( A \cup B = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \} \)
- \( A \cap B = \{ 3, 4 \} \)
- \( A \setminus B = \{ 1, 2 \} \)
- \( B \setminus A = \{ 5, 6 \} \)
:::

::: {#exm-set-operations-intervals}
## Set Operations with Intervals

Let \( A = [0, 2] \) and \( B = [1, 3] \) be intervals in \( \nR \). Then:

- \( A \cup B = [0, 3] \)
- \( A \cap B = [1, 2] \)
- \( A \setminus B = [0, 1) \)
:::

::: {.remark}
In linear algebra, we will see that the **intersection** of two subspaces is always a subspace, but the **union** of two subspaces is generally *not* a subspace (this is a common exam question!). Instead of union, we use the **sum** of subspaces: \( U + W = \{ u + w : u \in U, w \in W \} \).
