# Bases

We have reached what many consider the "Goldilocks Zone" of Linear Algebra.

If a set is too small, it won't span the whole space—you'll be left with points you can't reach. If a set is too large, it will be linearly dependent—you'll have redundant vectors cluttering your workspace. A **basis** is a set that is "just right." It is large enough to build everything, but small enough that every piece is essential.

Because a basis has no redundancy, it gives us something incredible: a **unique address system**. In an abstract vector space, it's hard to tell someone where a vector is. But once we pick a basis, every vector can be described by a unique list of numbers—its coordinates. A basis is the bridge that allows us to turn abstract geometry into concrete arithmetic.

## Basis

A subset \( B \) of a vector space \( V \) is called a **basis** for \( V \) if:

1. \( B \) is linearly independent;
2. \( B \) spans \( V \).
:::

::: {#exm-standard-bases}
## Standard Bases

- The **standard basis** for \( F^n \) is \( \{ \ve_1, \ve_2, \dots, \ve_n \} \), where \( \ve_i \) has a 1 in the \( i \)-th position and 0 elsewhere.
- The standard basis for \( F[x]_{\leq n} \) is \( \{ 1, x, x^2, \dots, x^n \} \).
- The standard basis for \( M_{m \times n}(F) \) is the set of matrices \( \mE_{ij} \) having a 1 at entry \( (i,j) \) and 0 elsewhere.

## Unique Representation and Coordinates

The most important property of a basis is that every vector in the space has a unique "address" relative to it.

::: {#thm-unique-representation}
## Unique Representation

Let \( B = \{ \vv_1, \dots, \vv_n \} \) be a basis for \( V \). Then every vector \( \vv \in V \) can be written as a linear combination of elements in \( B \) in **exactly one way**.
:::

::: {.proof}
Since \( B \) spans \( V \), there exist scalars \( a_i \) such that \( \vv = \sum a_i \vv_i \). Suppose there is another representation \( \vv = \sum b_i \vv_i \). Then:
\[
	\vzero = \vv - \vv = \sum a_i \vv_i - \sum b_i \vv_i = \sum (a_i - b_i) \vv_i.
\]
Since \( B \) is linearly independent, we must have \( a_i - b_i = 0 \) for all \( i \), meaning \( a_i = b_i \).
:::

::: {#def-coordinates}
## Coordinates

Let \( B = \{ \vv_1, \dots, \vv_n \} \) be an **ordered** basis for \( V \). For any \( \vv \in V \), the unique scalars \( c_1, \dots, c_n \) such that \( \vv = \sum c_i \vv_i \) are called the **coordinates** of \( \vv \) with respect to \( B \). We write this as a column vector:
\[
	[\vv]_B = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix}.
\]
:::

::: {.remark}
The map \( \vv \mapsto [\vv]_B \) provides a way to treat any abstract \( n \)-dimensional vector space as if it were simply \( F^n \). This is the power of a basis.
